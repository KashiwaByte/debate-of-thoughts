Paragraph 2 (First Sub-Argument - Mental Health):

The first sub-argument focuses on the negative impact of social media on mental health. Studies have shown a correlation between excessive social media use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Data from research studies indicate that individuals who spend more time on social media platforms tend to experience higher levels of psychological distress. This data argument is further supported by theoretical arguments that highlight the addictive nature of social media and its role in exacerbating mental health issues.

Academic studies highlight the role of social media in fostering online harassment and cyberbullying, further deteriorating societal well-being. Thus, the argument against the benefit of social media on societal well-being is supported by empirical data and theoretical frameworks.

当前环节为：正方驳论
本环节的论述是：As a senior and top debater with strong logic, I will now refute the opponent's argument against the statement "Is social media beneficial for society?" with a negative stance. I will address the points made in the opponent's argument and provide counterarguments based on logical reasoning and evidence.

1. **Mental Health Impact**:
   - The opponent argues that social media has a negative impact on mental health, citing studies that show a correlation between excessive social media use and psychological distress. While it is true that overuse of social media can lead to issues like anxiety and depression, it is essential to consider the nuances of this relationship. 
   - Counterargument: Social media can also provide a sense of community and support for individuals facing mental health challenges. Many online platforms offer resources, support groups, and connections that can positively impact mental well-being. It is not solely the platform itself but how it is used that determines its effect on mental health.

2. **Societal Well-Being**:
   - The opponent highlights the negative aspects of social media on societal well-being, such as the spread of misinformation and polarization of opinions. They argue that social media contributes to societal division and conflict.
   - Counterargument: While it is true that social media can amplify misinformation and polarize opinions, it also serves as a tool for spreading awareness, mobilizing social movements, and fostering connections across diverse communities. Social media has been instrumental in raising awareness about social issues, promoting activism, and facilitating dialogue between individuals with different perspectives.

3. **Overall Impact**:
   - The opponent's argument focuses on the detrimental effects of social media on mental health and societal well-being, painting a bleak picture of its influence on society.
   - Counterargument: It is important to acknowledge that social media is a complex and multifaceted tool that can have both positive and negative impacts. While there are challenges associated with its use, dismissing its potential benefits overlooks the opportunities for communication, collaboration, and empowerment that social media provides to individuals and communities.

In conclusion, while it is crucial to address the negative aspects of social media and mitigate potential harms, it is equally important to recognize the positive contributions it can make to society. A balanced approach that considers both the drawbacks and benefits of social media is essential in evaluating its overall impact on society.

当前环节为：反方驳论
本环节的论述是：The opponent's argument presents a well-structured and coherent analysis of the benefits of social media for society. However, there are several points that can be refuted or challenged based on different perspectives and counterarguments. Here are some potential refutations:

1. **Selective Data Interpretation**: The opponent's argument relies heavily on statistics and data to support the positive impact of social media on communication and knowledge dissemination. However, it is essential to consider the quality of information shared on social media platforms. Misinformation, fake news, and echo chambers are prevalent on social media, leading to polarization and misinformation among users. The argument fails to address the negative consequences of these aspects.

2. **Privacy Concerns and Data Exploitation**: While social media enhances communication and connectivity, it also raises significant privacy concerns. Social media platforms often collect user data for targeted advertising and other purposes, raising questions about data privacy and security. The argument overlooks the potential risks and implications of data exploitation by social media companies.

3. **Impact on Mental Health**: The argument focuses on the positive aspects of social media but neglects to address the negative impact on mental health. Studies have shown a correlation between excessive social media use and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The argument fails to acknowledge the potential harm social media can have on individuals' well-being.

4. **Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers**: While social media platforms claim to promote inclusivity and diversity in communication channels, they also contribute to the formation of filter bubbles and echo chambers. Users are often exposed to content that aligns with their existing beliefs, leading to polarization and limited exposure to diverse perspectives. The argument does not address how social media exacerbates these issues.

5. **Algorithmic Bias and Manipulation**: Social media algorithms play a significant role in determining the content users see, leading to algorithmic bias and manipulation. The argument does not consider how algorithmic decisions can influence the information users are exposed to, potentially shaping their views and opinions in a biased manner.

In conclusion, while the opponent's argument highlights the positive aspects of social media for society, it overlooks critical issues such as misinformation, privacy concerns, mental health impacts, filter bubbles, and algorithmic bias. A comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of social media is necessary to evaluate its overall impact on society accurately.
